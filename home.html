          <h4>
          The New York Times is committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce, one that reflects the varied global community that we serve. Our journalism and the products we build in the service of that journalism greatly benefit from a range of perspectives that can only come from diversity across our ranks, at all levels of the organization. Our dedication to diversity and inclusion is the right thing to do, and it is also the smart thing for our business.
          <h4>
          <h3>
          The purpose of this website is to serve as an informational resource about the different facets of diversity within the company, and to give you the opportunity to become a part of one of these diverse initiatives. We hope that employees, in all levels and sections of the organization, will use this website to feel included and informed about the diversity initiatives that exist to bring us closer together.
