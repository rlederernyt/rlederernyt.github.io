        <h3>The New York Times is committed to being an inclusive and equitable place to work for every individual, so in 2017 Talent & Inclusion introduced unconscious bias training for all employees. Unconscious bias education helps us all recognize and ultimately minimize how biases may affect our decision-making. Paradigm, a team of experts in this area, facilitated several in-person training for our colleagues in 2016. These are the <a href = "https://insite.nyt.net/2016/06/07/unconscious-bias/">results of the survey</a> we sent to all the workshop attendees:

          * 97% of respondents intend to engage in behaviors to reduce bias.<br>

        <h3>
          At The New York Times, building a talented and diverse workforce is a vital part of our mission. We are committed to a hiring process that is inclusive, fair and transparent, and one that puts emphasis on the company's commitment to career development. While every department is unique and has its own needs, <a href = "https://sites.google.com/nytimes.com/recruitment-toolkit/core-principles">this toolkit</a> is intended to help toward those goals. We have identified four mandatory core principles that apply across the company:
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <i>
            <b>
             1. Post the job.
            </b>
            <br>All open positions must be posted. The few exceptions will require masthead- or E.V.P.-level approval.<br>
            <b>2. Accept applications in Workday.<br></b> Serious candidates must submit their applications through Workday. This helps us track our recruiting efforts, which is a legal requirement and makes our work more effective.<br>
            <b>3. Seek a diverse pool of applicants.</b><br>At a minimum, the qualified candidates we consider for every role should be gender diverse and include at least one person of color.<br>
            <b>4. Form a panel of interviewers from diverse backgrounds.<br></b>The interviewers must also be ethnically and gender diverse.</font></font>           <br></i>
