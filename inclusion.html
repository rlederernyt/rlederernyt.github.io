           <h3>On March 28, 2018, The New York Times released its <a href = "https://www.nytco.com/diversity-and-inclusion-at-the-new-york-times/"> inaugural public report </a>  on diversity and inclusion. In this report, we provide an overview of our efforts to build a more diverse and inclusive culture at The Times. And, for the first time, we are sharing detailed data about the ethnic and gender composition of our staff members — data that we intend to update and make public annually.</h3><br>

          <h3>The company is committed to being an inclusive and equitable place to work for every individual, so in 2017 Talent & Inclusion introduced unconscious bias training for all employees. Unconscious bias education helps us all recognize and ultimately minimize how biases may affect our decision-making. Paradigm, a team of experts in this area, facilitated several in-person trainings for our colleagues last year. </h3>

We're currently rolling out mandatory unconscious bias training to all hiring managers through an online vendor called Emtrain. The training was developed with Paradigm, the organization that facilitated our in-person training sessions.

                      <h6><div align = "right">When looking to fill our open positions, we consider a diverse candidate slate as well as ensure that our interview panels are diverse. This is our commitment."   <i>- Stacey Olive, VP Talent Acquisition</i></h6></div>

          <div align = "left"> <h3>
            At The New York Times, building a talented and diverse workforce is a vital part of our mission. We are committed to a hiring process that is inclusive, fair and transparent, and one that puts emphasis on the company's commitment to career development. While every department is unique and has its own needs, this toolkit is intended to help toward those goals. We have identified four mandatory core principles that apply across the company. These four principles are universal requirements, and part of the full hiring process detailed here.<br><br>
            <i><b><font size=2.5px><font color = "grey"><div align = "right">Post the job:</b> All open positions must be posted. The few exceptions will require masthead- or E.V.P.-level approval.
<b>Accept applications in Workday:</b> Serious candidates must submit their applications through Workday. This helps us track our recruiting efforts, which is a legal requirement and makes our work more effective.
<b>Seek a diverse pool of applicants:</b>  At a minimum, the qualified candidates we consider for every role should be gender diverse and include at least one person of color.
<b>Form a panel of interviewers from diverse backgrounds:</b> The interviewers must also be ethnically and gender diverse.</font></font>            <br></div>
