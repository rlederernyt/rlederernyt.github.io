In this report, we provide an overview of our efforts to build a more diverse and inclusive culture at The Times. And, for the first time, we are sharing detailed data about the ethnic and gender composition of our staff members — data that we intend to update and make public annually.</h3>

        <h3>The New York Times is committed to being an inclusive and equitable place to work for every individual, so in 2017 Talent & Inclusion introduced unconscious bias training for all employees. Unconscious bias education helps us all recognize and ultimately minimize how biases may affect our decision-making. Paradigm, a team of experts in this area, facilitated several in-person training for our colleagues in 2016. These are the <a href = "https://insite.nyt.net/2016/06/07/unconscious-bias/">results of the survey</a> we sent to all the workshop attendees:</h3>

        <h6><br><br><i><b><font size = 5pt>Of those who attended training...</b><br></font>
          99% of respondents understand the concept of unconscious bias.<br>
          86% of respondents thought the material was relevant to them.<br>
          97% of respondents intend to engage in behaviors to reduce bias.<br>
          90% of respondents would recommend the workshop to a colleague.<br>
          Respondents said that Team Dynamics was the section of the workshop that was the greatest benefit to them. Some responses include: “it’s something we can use every day,” “it was very clear how much room for improvement there was,” and “it’s something that I’m very aware of and affects me daily.”</i>

          At The New York Times, building a talented and diverse workforce is a vital part of our mission. We are committed to a hiring process that is inclusive, fair and transparent, and one that puts emphasis on the company's commitment to career development. While every department is unique and has its own needs, this toolkit is intended to help toward those goals. We have identified four mandatory core principles that apply across the company. These four principles are universal requirements, and part of the full hiring process detailed <a href = "https://sites.google.com/nytimes.com/recruitment-toolkit/core-principles">here.</a>
