I think you should bring your background - whether it’s ethnic, racial, or if you grew up abroad or in New York, or in the South - I think you should bring that to the table. Newsrooms have to make decisions that reflect some sense of the world and I think the only way to do that is to have people from different parts of the world.” <br><i> <br>- Dean Baquet, Executive Editor</i></h2>

        <div align = "left"> <h6><i>“Our audience is much more diverse than where we were five years ago. Our audience has grown an enormous amount and our audience has gotten younger, more female, more likely to be from places other than just the coasts, more global and so forth. I think it's imperative that the groups of people making the NYT, marketing the NYT, distributing the NYT reflect the increasingly diverse audience.”</i><br><br> – Meredith Kopit Levien, Chief Operating Officer</h6></div>

<h2>Race/Related</h2>
<h3>Race/Related Meetings are weekly meetings that merge the Business and Newsroom to discuss news coverage as it relates to race and diversity. They allow employees around the company to openly convey emotions and thoughts regarding race within the news coverage and various perspectives that should be considered when covering specific news stories. The group  sends out a <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2016/race-related/index.html"> newsletter</a> "exploring race with provocative reporting and discussion."<br> <br> <i>Meetings every Tuesday, 11 a.m. 4th Floor PO-N-Large-04P2-320</i>
</h3></div>

<div align = "right"> <h6><i>“Marc [Lacey] has ably led our newly established team on race, collaborating with a range of desks and editors to tell the story of race and identity in new forms, including the Race/Related newsletter, the interactive on how views of the police shaped interpretations of body camera videos, and a stream of ambitious stories and social callouts.” </i><br> – Dean Baquet, Executive Editor</div></h6>

<div align = "left"> <h2> NYT Student Journalism Institute </h2>
  <h3>The Institute is offered once a year in May. Participants must be students (or December or May graduates) who are members of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists or the National Association of Black Journalists or students at a historically black college or university. In a supportive environment of students and staff who share the same goals, aspiring journalists are given the opportunity to learn to produce material that meets the standards of the most prestigious and demanding news organizations in the nation.</h3>

  <div align = "right"><h6>
"At my school, there’s not really space to network with other black journalists... it was cool to have a space where everyone is part of that community. You realize you're not alone in this feeling of uncomfortability or struggle... it helps you understand your place in the industry a little bit more and feel comfortable trying to navigate it, knowing that there are other people thinking about the exact same things. And it’s even cooler knowing that there are people who are staff here at the Times who are also thinking about it, and they’re willing to take the time to help bring us up the pipeline. It was a really positive experience." <br><br><i>– Tyler Blint-Welsh, NYTSJI Alum, Metro Intern </i>
