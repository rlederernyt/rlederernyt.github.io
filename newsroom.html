Our audience has grown an enormous amount and our audience has gotten younger, more female, more likely to be from places other than just the coasts, more global and so forth. I think it's imperative that the groups of people making the New York Times, marketing the New York Times, distributing the New York Times, reflect the increasingly diverse audience.”<br><br> <b>– Meredith Kopit Levien, Chief Operating Officer</b></blockquote>

            "It was cool to have a space where everyone is part of that community. You realize you're not alone in this feeling of uncomfortability or struggle... it helps you understand your place in the industry a little bit more and feel comfortable trying to navigate it, knowing that there are other people thinking about the exact same things. And it’s even cooler knowing that there are people who are staff here at the Times who are also thinking about it, and they’re willing to take the time to help bring us up the pipeline. It was a really positive experience." <br><br><i>– Tyler Blint-Welsh, NYTSJI Alum, Metro Intern </i>
