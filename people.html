          <h2> “It’s hard to imagine a company where it’s easier to articulate the importance of diversity than a news organization that is trying to shine the light on the understanding of the world... We want The New York Times to be for everyone and to reflect the actual experience of the world and the diversity of experience in the world and the diversity of identity in the world. You can’t do that unless diversity is the core tenant of the place." </h2>
          <h4>– A.G. Sulzberger, publisher</h4>
          <h2>"Don’t assume that how you feel, whether that’s good or bad or has room for improvement, is always as understood as it can be, or should be, and call it out... I think it’s the job of people like me to make sure that you have the forum to call it out." </h2>
          <h4>– Meredith Kopit Levien, COO</i></h4>
          <h2> I think I can show how proud I am of my heritage and how cool it is to be different. Also, embracing everybody else because we have people here from all different backgrounds. White, Black, Asian, everybody brings so much to the table; it’s great to see so many people from different backgrounds working together towards one big goal. Make The New York Times a bigger, better company.</h2><h4>-Deyanira Martinez</h4>
