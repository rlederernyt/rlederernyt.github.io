              Arab Collective<br>
              <h5> The NYT Arab Collective brings together Company staff members of Arab descent and those with interest in the region to encourage deepened awareness and understanding of Arab culture, history and current events. For many Arab-Americans and Arabs who come to The Times from other communities where they have felt isolated, our ERG is a visible signal that they do not have to be alone. Especially at a time of heightened political tensions involving Arabs and Muslims, who are often identified with terrorism or subject to prejudice, our group can be a supportive force.
                Many Arab immigrants who have come to The Times have left behind societies in crisis, and struggle to come to terms with a sense of displacement. This group offers a solid foundation from which they can develop both professionally and personally.
                Our group serves as a resource for the newsroom and business side and aims to nourish a sense of community among members, offer mutual support, and organize cultural events and volunteer activities. Our involvement demonstrates the company’s commitment to a diverse array of people, experience and perspectives. We have five specific areas of focus:
                – Meet regularly to discuss current affairs and the challenges facing Arabs and Arab-Americans in today’s fraught political environment.
                – Organize events tied to Arab culture or themes in the news: These could include speakers, panel discussions moderated by a staff member, organized film viewings, etc.
                – Provide informal mentorship to young, developing journalists and business-side employees.
                – Attract talented candidates of Arab origin for job openings on the news and business sides.
                – Provide expertise through a Stylebook committee to improve the accuracy of language we use in the report and establish a public Slack channel to allow staffers to ask questions and share expertise.
